# MusicNST

Project to combine and experiment with Neural Style Transfer with Music.

## Tests

We test multiple setups:

* NST (with VGG) with MIDI straight into it
* Modified NST (with our own custom model predicting song's artist) with MIDI pushed straight through
* NST with lower dimensional music (sampled from MusicVAE)
* Modified NST with lower dimensional music

## Models
There are a couple of models to keep track of here. I will list them and provide documentation about them here.

* [Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf)
* [MusicVAE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05428.pdf
* [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) (we opted for 16 instead of 19 because why not)
* Custom Model (discussed below)
